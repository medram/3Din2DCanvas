# 3Din2DCanvas !
Hi there!
I've just created the 3D from scratch in 2D canvas (reinventing) using Javascript, Based on some 3D algorithms.

# Features:
This 3D supports the folowing features:
- Z Buffer for depth testing.
- FrameBuffer (useful for making cool filters like Anti-aliasing, Motion blur, Depth fading & mush more...)
- Rendring lines from A to B & coloring it.
- Filling the triangles & coloring it.
- Parallel Lighting (like sun light).

# Cons:
- It's slow because of javascript.
- Lines rendring could be improved.

# Next Features:
I will add these features in the future:
- Anti-Aliasing (FXAA).
- improving lines rendring.

# How to use:
To start a php server on the root folder of 3Din2Dcanvas, you could use:
```
php -S localhost:5500
```
And go to the browser & tap localhost:5500
and there we go :D
# Note:
I'm using just the sorting algorithm for the trangles.
