# 3Din2DCanvas !
Hi there!
I've just created the 3d from scratch in 2d canvas, Based on some 3d algorithms 

# How to use:
To start a php server on the root folder of 3Din2Dcanvas, you could use:
```
php -S localhost:5500
```
And go to the browser & tap localhost:5500
and there we go :D
# Note:
I'm using just the sorting algorithm for the trangles.
