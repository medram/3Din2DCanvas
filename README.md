# 3Din2DCanvas !
Hi there!
I've just created the 3D from scratch in 2D canvas (reinventing the wheel) using just pure Javascript, Based on some 3D algorithms.

# Features:
This 3D supports the folowing features:
- Z Buffer for depth testing.
- FrameBuffer (useful for making cool filters like Anti-aliasing, Motion blur, Depth fading & mush more...)
- Rendring lines from A to B & coloring it.
- Filling the triangles & coloring it.
- Parallel Lighting (like sun light).

# Cons:
- It's slow because of javascript.
- Lines rendring could be improved.

# Next Features:
I will add these features on future:
- Anti-Aliasing (FXAA).
- improving lines rendring.
- increasing FPS by improving some area rendering.
- Texturing
- Smooth shading

# How to use:
To start a php server on the root folder of 3Din2Dcanvas, you could use:
```
php -S localhost:5500
```
And go to the browser & tap localhost:5500
and there you go :D
## Controls
To control the camera, you could use Z, D, S, Q buttons with Up, Down, Left and Right arrows to control camera position and direction.
In addition, you could enable/disable some modes using your keyboard number pad:
- Clipping mode (click 2 button).
- Fake normals mode (click 3 button).
- Log camera info on console (click 4 button).
- Draw lines (click 5 button).
- Fill triangles (click 6 button).
