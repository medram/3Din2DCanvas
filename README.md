# 3Din2DCanvas !
Hi there!
I've just created the 3D from scratch in 2D canvas (reinventing the wheel) using just pure Javascript, Based on some 3D algorithms.

# Features:
This 3D supports the folowing features:
- Z Buffer for depth testing.
- FrameBuffer (useful for making cool filters like Anti-aliasing, Motion blur, Depth fading & mush more...)
- Rendring lines from A to B & coloring it.
- Filling the triangles & coloring it.
- Parallel Lighting (like sun light).

# Cons:
- It's slow because of javascript.
- Lines rendring could be improved.

# Next Features:
<<<<<<< HEAD
I will add these features on future:
- Anti-Aliasing (FXAA).
- improving lines rendring.
- increasing FPS by improving some area rendering.
=======
I will add these features in the future:
- Anti-Aliasing (FXAA).
- improving lines rendring.
- Texturing
